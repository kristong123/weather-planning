      <h2>Problem Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Planning outdoor activities around the weather is a common challenge,
        especially for people with busy schedules. The unpredictability of
        weather conditions often forces last-minute changes to plans or missed
        opportunities for exciting activities. However, most calendar and
        weather apps exist individually, leaving users to manually align the
        two. This disconnect becomes more frustrating as the weather fluctuates
        and people's schedules change back and forth. A key information
        technology problem is the lack of intelligent integration between
        weather forecasting services and personal scheduling tools. Existing
        solutions, like weather apps (<a
          class="link"
          href="https://openweathermap.org/"
          >OpenWeatherMap</a
        >) or digital calendars (Google Calendar), do not automatically suggest
        or reschedule activities based on forecasted conditions. Although some
        apps have attempted to bridge this gap, they often lack dynamic calendar
        syncing or deep personalization. They fail to consider calendar
        availability or allow for detailed user preferences tied to specific
        weather types. As a result, there remains a need for a system that not
        only understands user preferences and schedules but also makes
        proactive, weather-smart planning decisions.

      <h2>App Description</h2>
      <p>
        Our app is intended for users of all ages and backgrounds who want to
        schedule activities based on their personal schedules and preferred
        weather conditions. It will be particularly helpful for users who wish
        to do activities that require specific weather conditions, such as
        skiing or snowboarding, surfing, or cycling.

          Users can interact with the app by inputting their regular schedule
          into the built-in calendar feature. Events such as classes or work
          will be included here. Then, the user can input extra activities they
          want to do into another section. Here, they can specify the weather
          conditions they prefer for these activities. For example, if they
          wanted to go skiing, it would be preferable if it snowed the day or
          night before. Then, at the click of a button, the app will connect
          with a weather API called
          <a class="link" href="https://open-meteo.com/"
            >Open-metro Free Weather API</a
          >
          and automatically generate a schedule that incorporates these
          additional activities into the user's calendar at specific dates and
          times that match the preferred weather conditions for each activity.
          If the user would like to make changes to the schedule given to them,
          they can modify the schedule and move items around to their liking.

        This app solves the problem of planning extracurricular activities
        around normally busy schedules. Instead of manually comparing weather
        and scheduling apps, ours combines both functionalities. This saves time
        and incentivizes people to be more proactive and flexible in planning.
